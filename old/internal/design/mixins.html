MzScheme provides mixins via <TT>lambda</TT>-<TT>class</TT> combinations,
and these mixins ultimately inspired the paper ``Classes and Mixins''
in POPL 98. But the language presented in the paper, an extension of
Java called M<font size=-1><small>IXED</small></font>J<font size=-1><small>AVA</small></font>, is stronger than MzScheme's mixins. Should
we change MzScheme to approximiate that mixin language more closely ?
<P>
The answer depends on the answers to the following smaller
questions:
<P>
<UL><LI> How can we change MzScheme to support mixins more directly?<LI> If we change the language, will the DrScheme code improve?<LI> If we change the language, will extenal users be greatly affected?
</UL>
<P>
Given our shortage of programmers, the second of the small questions
dominates the overall decision.
<P>
After deliberation, the big answer is ``no, we shouldn't change
MzScheme''. The little answers, discussed in detail below, include a
specific design proposal, ``DrScheme does not sufficiently benefit
from the change'', and ``we don't know whether anyone else cares''.
<P>
Apart from the main decision, it appears that DrScheme could benefit
from a small part of the proposed change to MzScheme. The debate about
whether to make this small change should be resumed at some point in
the future.
<P>
There is little academic interest in making the changes at this point,
since the mixins paper has already been published and follow-up work
is unlikely in the near future. (If we had more manpower to implement
the changes, we could also produce more published work on these
mixins, such as papers on performance and implementation techniques).
<P>
<H1><A NAME="SECTION00010000000000000000">Changing the Language</A></H1>
<P>
<UL><LI> In a M<font size=-1><small>IXED</small></font>J<font size=-1><small>AVA</small></font> program, method declarations can be syntactically
identified as <B>overriding methods</B> (the superclass must define
the methed and it will be overridden) and <B>fresh methods</B>
(regardless of whether the superclass defines the method, the mixin's
declaration does not override it). The syntactic distinction is
performed by examining the interface that is ``extended'' by the
mixin.
<P>
MzScheme interfaces are first-class values and thus cannot serve to
distinguish overriding and fresh instance variable
declarations. Instead, we could split MzScheme's <TT>public</TT> clause
into <TT>public-override</TT> and <TT>public-fresh</TT> clauses.<LI> M<font size=-1><small>IXED</small></font>J<font size=-1><small>AVA</small></font> does not allow accessing an ambiguous method name
in an instance (the method call is disallowed at type-checking). An
alternative design is to automatically select the leftmost occurrence
of a method in the instance.
<P>
Since accessing an ambiguous instance variable is likely to be an
error, the revised MzScheme language should also disallow ambiguous
<TT>ivar</TT> lookups. Obviously, this will be a run-time error, but it is
an inexpensive check in the current architecture.<LI> As the paper's <TT>get</TT> example demonstrates, it is sometimes
necessary to refine the view of an instance in order to ensure that a
method is accessed as intended or to disambiguate a method call.
<P>
The revised MzScheme language would need a <TT>view</TT> form/procedure
that takes an instance and an interface or class and returns a new
reference to the instance with a restricted view. (Probably,
interfaces would be only used with <TT>view</TT> since interfaces
are the only way to assign names to MzScheme mixins.)<LI> In M<font size=-1><small>IXED</small></font>J<font size=-1><small>AVA</small></font>, <TT>this</TT> within a mixin declaration
is a reference to the ``current instance'' with a restricted
view. Thus, even after passing <TT>this</TT> to an external method, the
reference to the object continues to behave as expected by the
programmer providing <TT>this</TT>.  The typing constraints make it
relatively natural to require a <TT>view</TT> expression for explicitly
narrowing the type of a reference.
<P>
MzScheme's <TT>this</TT> should not be changed: <TT>this</TT> should remain
as a reference to the current instance with the maximal view. That
design choice is more natural for Scheme since the programmer expects
the client accepting the <TT>this</TT> reference to dynamically determine
the type and use of the instance.
<P>
However, even in a dynamically typed language it may be useful to
obtain a reference to the ``current instance'' with a view restricted
to the current mixin. (For example, suppose
<TT>SecureDoor</TT>'s <TT>canOpen</TT> method calls <TT>get</TT> to obtain the
needed item.) Thus, a <TT>this/local</TT> built-in variable should be
added with the same lexical scope as <TT>this</TT>, but bound to the
instance with a restricted view instead of the maximal view. The
programmer can then decide which reference is appropriate.
</UL><H1><A NAME="SECTION00020000000000000000">The Impact on DrScheme</A></H1>
<P>
Changing DrScheme to work in a revised object system would take a few
days or a week (in the recorder's informed opinion; the group did not
directly discuss this question).  Changing DrScheme to <EM>take
advantage</EM> of a revised mixin language would take six months (in the
group's informed opinion).
<P>
Even if DrScheme is changed to benefit from the revised language, the
value of these benefits is probably not great. The paper proclaims the
advantages of mixins as compared to classes, not as compared to a
weaker mixin language like MzScheme's. In other words: MzScheme
handles <TT>LockedShortDoor</TT> and <TT>SecureDoor</TT> fine, but not
<TT>LockedMagicDoor</TT> -- does it really matter? For DrScheme, the
answer seems to be ``no''. DrScheme relies heavily on patterns like
<TT>LockedShortDoor</TT>, but does not require <TT>LockedMagicDoor</TT>s.
<P>
After comparing costs and benefits of changing MzScheme and DrScheme,
it appares that DrScheme would not benefit from a revised object
system in proportion to the effort required to implement the changes.
However, there may be some merit in the first part of the proposal --
adding <TT>public-override</TT> and <TT>public-fresh</TT> clauses -- for
improving DrScheme's self-documentation and self-checking. At some
point in the future, we should consider adding a <TT>public-fresh</TT>
clause where the superclass must <EM>not</EM> have already defined the
fresh method.
<P>
<H1><A NAME="SECTION00030000000000000000">The Impact on Others</A></H1>
<P>
It is unclear how many users outside of Rice rely on the current
object system, but certainly we have never changed such an old and
stable portion of the language to such a degree. Nevertheless, a
gradual phase-in for the changes (e.g., keeping <TT>public</TT> for a
while, along with the new public clauses) is probably sufficient to
stay on good terms with the handful of developers using the object
system. Since there is a reasonable upgrade path, our users will
survive the change if it is deemed worthwhile.
