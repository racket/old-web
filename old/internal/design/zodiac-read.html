    <h1>Parameterization in Zodiac:read</h1>

    Under certain conditions, DrScheme's Check Syntax button causes an
    internal error. They are:
    <ul>
      <li> DrScheme was started with a file, </li>
      <li> Execute has not been clicked, and </li>
      <li> There is a symbol in the input. </li>
    </ul>

    In those conditions, <tt>zodiac:read</tt> is called with <tt>#f</tt>,
    instead of a parameterization and it fails. Five possible solutions
    were presented:
    <ol>
      <li> Change <tt>zodiac:read</tt> to accept only a boolean instead of
	a parameterization. The boolean would be used for case sensitivity, 

	which is the only parameter that the reader currently inspects.
      </li>
      <li> Always initialize the repl when DrScheme is started up.
	<ul> <li> Use threads to avoid some of the cost. </li> </ul>
      </li>
      <li> Don't show the Check Syntax button until Execute has been
	clicked. 
      </li>
      <li> Initialize the REPL when Check Syntax is clicked the first
	time. 
      </li>
      <li> Get the case-sensitive from the current parameterization, rather 

	than passing a parameterization.
      </li>
    </ol>

    For version 51, we choose to do solution 1, and for 52 we will do
    solution 5.
