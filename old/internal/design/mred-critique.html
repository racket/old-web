<h2>mred:item interface</h2>

Currently, no specification exists to indicate how MrEd GUI
components may be composed dynamically.  In addition to
writing external documentation, we could enforce composition
constraints with types.  For example, objects from any of several 
MrEd classes can be children of panels.  Abstracting over those 
kinds of objects, we arrive at an interface, <tt>mred:item</tt>, 
which describes per-node operations on composites.  We use an interface 
rather than a superclass, because there is no state description 
shared among the MrEd classes for these objects.  For instance,
a listbox's state is different than a checkbox's state.  The
interface operations might include

<ul>
<li>insert-item
<li>insert-item-list
<li>delete-item
</ul>
