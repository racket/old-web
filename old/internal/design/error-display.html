    <h1>error-display-handler</h1>
From Robby:
<P>
I would like to propose a change to the standard parameter
infrastructure for version 200. It is a minor change, unlikely to
affect "normal" mzscheme programmers, but it makes the organization of
DrScheme simpler and makes errortrace work slightly better.
<P>
Right now, there is a parameter called:
<P>
<tt>error-display-handler : (parameter (string -> void))</tt>
<P>
that is called by the exception handler to print the error message. I
would like to see it accept one more argument:
<P>
<tt>error-display-handler : (parameter (string TST -> void))</tt>
<P>
The additional argument should be the value passed to `raise'.
<P>
This change facilitates errortrace because it will now only have to set
the error-display-handler to be able to display the contexts (which
means that it will work more often). In DrScheme, I actually introduce
another parameter (error-display-handler/exn) that works just like the
revised error-display-handler. Its default value just calls the
error-display-handler, but the error-display-handler/exn parameter is
set in various languages to show the bug and file icons next to the
error message in the REPL.
