    <h1>Enhancements to GUI tester</h1>

<p>
    As things stand, the GUI tester is undocumented, both internally and
    externally.  In the process of reorganizing the code, I have added some
    comments; more is needed.  When I've developed some better structure
    for the code, I'll describe it here.
</p>

<p>
    Also, there are disparate testing mechanisms for different code bases.
    For example, MrSpidey has testing mechanisms different from MrEd's.
    While it is true that the different code bases are now maintained by
    different individuals, the testers should be usable by others.
    Eventually, the current maintainers will be elsewhere; also, the person
    responsible for releases should be able to verify the release.
</p>

<p>
    Proposed new test items:
</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Ensure that the initial basis in mred is as documented. Four
      places need to be checked:
	<ol>
	  <li> in the console window, </li>
	  <li> in a "-A"-style application, </li>
	  <li> in a "--non-unitized"-style application, and </li>
	  <li> in the MrEd vocabulary in DrScheme</li>
	</ol>
      </li>

      <li>Toggle items in the Language|Configure language|Show Details
      dialog, and check that they do the right thing
      </li>

      <li>Toggle items in the Edit|Preferences dialog, and check behavior
      </li>

      <li>Also toggle items in the MrSpidey Edit|Preferences dialog, and check
	results</li>
      <li>
	Include tests from the prs, outlined in this table:

      </li>
    </ul>
