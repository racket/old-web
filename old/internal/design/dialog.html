    <h1>Enhancements to file dialogs</h1>

<p>
Proposed changes:
</p>

<li>Keypress scrolls to first filename past the current
position beginning with that key
</li>     

<li>Up and down arrow keys should do the right thing
</li>     

<li>Eliminate GO button, use &LT;RETURN&GT; key instead
</li>     

<li>Add UPDIR button, a la Win95
</li>

<li>PageUp and PageDown should scroll by a page at a time.
</li>

<li>The edit field at the bottom of the dialog should reflect
the current listbox selection
</li>

<p>

All of the above have been implemented, and committed to the
archive.  The dialogs need testing before the 51 release.

<p>

Robby had proposed that &LT;SPC&GT; and &LT;DEL&GT; work
as PageDown and PageUp, respectively.  I'm not sure such
duplication is necessary.  I, for one, was not familiar
with those key bindings.
