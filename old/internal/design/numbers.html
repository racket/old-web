    <h1>Floating-point and Rational Numbers in DrScheme</h1>

<p>

To avoid explaining floating-point numbers to students right away, we
will disallow decimal numbers as input in DrScheme's Beginner
language. (The interim solution of converting decimal inputs to exact
numbers was rejected on the grounds that if two different language
levels both accept an expression as legal, they should assign it the
same semantics.)

<p>

In case the student uses a transcendental function, such as
<tt>sqrt</tt> the decimal result will be printed with a leading
<tt>#i</tt>, and decimals prefixed with <tt>#i</tt> will be accepted
as input. This will enable a student to step through computations.

<p>

A related question is how to print non-integer rational
numbers. Humans are likely to find <tt>2<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></tt>
more readable than <tt>5/2</tt>. DrScheme could print <tt>5/2</tt> as
<tt>(+ 2 1/2)</tt>, but this may induce as much confusion as
clarification. (Do teachers understand that
<tt>2<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></tt> means
<tt>2+<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></tt>? Will the rewriting rules be
confusing?) The solution, for a future release, is that DrScheme will
print <tt>2<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></tt> using the editor's graphics
capabilities. This printed output can be cut-and-pasted to embed it in
a program.
