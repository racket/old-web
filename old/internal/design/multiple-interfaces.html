    <h1>Duplicate Interface Method Inheritance</h1>


<h2>Attendance:</h2>Shriram, Matthew, Robby, Pablito, Clements, Pablo, Matthias

<h2>Issue:</h2>
<p>
MzScheme currently allows classes and interfaces to implement multiple
interfaces defining the same instance variables.  As it stands, MzScheme
accepts all of the following expressions:
</p>

<pre>
<code>
(define i (interface () a))
(define j (interface () a))
(interface (i) a)
(interface (i j))
(class* null (i j) () (public a))
</code>
</pre>

<p>
At least some of the above expressions ought not be allowed since they
most likely represent design errors.  Interfaces provide not only
syntactic restrictions such as required instance variable names, but also
informal semantic restrictions.  Two programmers who write different interfaces
that happen to use identical syntactic names may very well attach different
semantics to that name.  For example "read" could mean, "This file has been
read," or, "Read the file in now."  In light of these semantic obligations, a
class or interface which implements multiple interfaces that have a common
name likely contains an error.  
</p><p>

Everyone immediately agreed, though, that the following should be allowed
since the common name originated from a single interface:
</p>

<pre>
<code>
(define h (interface () a))
(define i (interface (h)))
(define j (interface (h)))
(interface (i j))
</code>
</pre>

<p>
Unfortunately, due to independent development, not wanting to change existing
code, or a general lack of foresight, common pieces of interfaces with
compatible semantics are not always factored out.  In this case, combining
two interfaces makes sense if the they have compatible semantics.  Matthew
pointed out that even if they do not have identical semantics, it may be
possible to implement both by dispatching on argument types.  In any case,
the programmer may have a legitimate reason to combine two such interfaces.
</p>
<h2>Resolution:</h2>
<p>
Since deciding if two functions have compatible semantics is uncomputable,
the language implementation can not prove that a program merging two
interfaces with identical components is in error.  Adding types still doesn't
provide enough information, so not even statically typed languages reject
such programs.
MzScheme will in the future reject only one of the questionable cases:
<code>(interface (i) a)</code> where <code>i</code> already contains
<code>a</code>.  In this case, if the programmer intended to require that
implementations of the interface provide a new service, the programmer
ought to choose a new name.  MzScheme should assume
the programmer is unaware of the former declaration, so in the future
it will signal this as an error.

</p>
