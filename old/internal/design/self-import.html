    <CENTER><h1>Allowing Self-Import in Units</h1></CENTER>

<p>

MzScheme's unit language currently disallows self-import, i.e., A
compound unit expression that links an export of a unit as an import
for the same unit. For version 100alpha1, the PLT decided that we
should remove the self-import restriction.

<H2>Why we can allow self-import</H2>

Origninally, there was an implementation reason for the self-import
restriction, but that reason no longer applies (the implementation of
units was broken at the time). We could lift the restriction in our
current implementation by simply removing the self-import syntactic
check for a compound-unit expression.

<P>

After the implementation was fixed, we preserved the self-import
restriction to avoid a certain kind of aliasing. Given a unit of the
form

<PRE>
  (unit (import i) (export e) ...),
</PRE>

the compiler can assume that set!ing e does not mutate i. But there's
no guarantee that i won't change as x is set!ed; i is imported as a
location rather than a value, and another thread could conceivably
mutate i at the same time that x is mutated. As a result, it's
difficult to see how the lack of aliasing really helps a compiler.

<P>

The more important constraint for a compiler is that if there is no
set! for an exported variable within the defining unit, then the
variable is known to be immutable. If we didn't have the set!
restriction on imported variables, then the no-aliasing feature might
be more important.

<H2>Why we should allow self-import</H2>

Suppose you're writing an ff-icfp98 kind of program, and you add a
`shrink' method, which creates instances. The following is obviously
not right:

<PRE>
 (unit (import base%) (export shrinkable%)
  (define shrinkable%
    (class base% ()
     (public
      [shrink (lambda () (make-object shrinkable% ...))]
       ..))))
</PRE>

One solution is to use a virtual constructor. Another solution is to
import the class to instantiate:

<PRE>
 (unit (import base% final%) (export shrinkable%)
  (define shrinkable%
    (class base% ()
     (public
      [shrink (lambda () (make-object final% ...))]
       ..))))
</PRE>

If shrinkable% is actually the final class, then you'd like to link
the unit's shrinkable% export as the unit's final% import, but our
self-import restriction doesn't allow it.

<H2>Why the example might be bogus</H2>

The above example assumes that the set of initialization arguments to
the class never changes. What if we apply a color-mixin to
shrinkable%, which adds an initialization argument to initialize the
shape's color? In this case, perhaps a clone-with-new-size method is a
better solution --- as long as color-mixin overrides
clone-with-new-size. 

<P>

However, is seems that this strategy does not scale as new attributes
and new object-creating methods are added, anyway. If set!-based
initializers are used, then the self-import strategy stil works.

<H2>Conclusion</H2>

The specific example may be weak, but there are plenty of other such
examples that show up in the recursive-module research. We suspect
that self-import is the right solution in some cases, and perhaps
we'll find a good example to install in this memo, eventually.

<P>

There did not appear to be a good technical reason to disallow
self-import, and it seemed that the proper design choice in this case
was the less-rules/less-checking-code/more-programs path.
