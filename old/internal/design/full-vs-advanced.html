Subject: Full vs Advanced

Matthew, Robby and I have revisited the Full language level, 
after a bad failure that I had when developing a script/program. 

After re-hashing the issues, we have ended the conversation with 
this message. 

Robby: please move Full. I believe that PLT is the appropriate hierarchy. 
I also believe that we should call this HtDP-Enhanced (or something like 
that). It is, after all, a PLT-language with a few features from the  
teaching hierarchy thrown in. By moving it, we warn people that it does  
not respect the entire set of HtDP conventions.

  I'm still in favor of the latter.

  Merely *specifying* a Full extended from Advanced is a huge pain. And
  then there's the implementation task. Here's an extract of an earlier
  message on this topic:
