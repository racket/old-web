    <h1>Exceptions and modules</h1>
From Matthew:
<P>
I've spent the last day or so converting MzScheme so that it provides
module information in exception structures:
<P>
<tt>(struct exn (message agent module continuation-marks))</tt>
<P>
where the `agent' field is a symbol, and the `module' field is a module
symbol.
<P>
The idea was to help DrScheme connect error messages with
documentation. That connection is important, and on the surface, adding
procedure--module (or form--module) information to exceptions seems
like a good idea.
<P>
But now I think it's a bad idea. The change turns out to be fairly
painful --- not because it's a big change that's difficult to implement
(like `syntax-case' or `module'), but because it's a small change that
pervades the entire system.
<P>
Examples: `error' must accept a syntax object instead of just a symbol
to identify the error reporter; procedure name inference must capture
module contexts, so that wrong-argument-count exceptions can identify
the procedure; `object-name' can't just return a symbol anymore,
because it should report the source module, too; structure procedure
names must be constructed to maintain the module context of the
supplied base name; many functions in the C API that take a procedure
name must be changed to take a module context.
<P>
To be clear, all of those changes are possible, and I expected many of
them when I started. But having completed the basic machinery, and with
a long road yet ahead, and with many performance concerns... I'm
inclined to call it overkill.
<P>
<HR>
<P>
How much can we do with just source-location information for errors?
<P>
In the case of syntax errors, the form name is not obvious from the
location, because the error may be highlighted in a specific part of
the expression. Since adding source form and module fields to
`exn:syntax' (instead of `exn') requires very little work, it seems
worthwhile.
<P>
In the case of run-time errors where the source location is an
application expression, the first sub-expression will tend to be the
funcion name, and its source module can be extracted from the syntax.
(DrScheme could detect this case by checking whether the function
expression is an identifier with a module binding.)
<P>
Functions-as-values defeat the heuristic that extracts a function name
from an application expression. But the programmer could probably
unwind the continuation enough to get to the original reference to the
function, and then click on that referece for documentation.
<P>
More generally, it seems relatively unlikely that an error would be
reported where the programmer can't easily click an identifier in the
source (where the module is known) to get documentation. 
<P>
That's all more complex than having the best possible link in the
exception record at all times, but it seems to me a more reasonable
distribution of complexity (isolated to the DrScheme--help connection,
instead of spreading throughout all code).
<P>
So summarize, I plan to throw away yesterday's work, and instead add
`form' and `module' fields to `exn:syntax'.
<P>
    <hr>
From Robby:
<P>
It sounds like the scheme you suggest might work fine for built-in
mzscheme primitives, but if we want to treat other imported modules as
primitives, we might need a little more help from the module
implementor.
<P>
I suggest that we add an `error/docs' procedure that accepts the extra
arguments. Module implementors can write code that calls that error
procedure and supply enough information to get to the right
documentation. That way we can work on this change slowly and with only
a small addition to mz that just describes the *protocol* for specifing
the needed information, but doesn't require it to be there.
<P>
&gt; More generally, it seems relatively unlikely that an error would be<BR>
&gt; reported where the programmer can't easily click an identifier in the<BR>
&gt; source (where the module is known) to get documentation.<BR> 
<P>
I don't believe this, since the "right" place to click on it going to
be somewhere in the context, which will appear to be gibberish to
everyone except the implementor of the module (judging from what I've
seen of the errortrace contexts of class's expansions). If I get a
structure selector error message because I've mis-used the class
system, I shouldn't get the the docs that describe structs -- I want to
get docs that describe how I've mis-called the class-system primitive
opertations. But, I might not know which place in the context is the
right place to click to get that information.
