  <body>
  At the PLT Meeting of
  <a href=https://internal.plt-scheme.org/meetings/980211.html>February 11,1998</a>,
  we discussed compatibility issues of successive DrScheme releases.
  Currently, releases are numbered sequentially, with no distinctions
  in status among them.  Because we plan to revise MrEd API's and
  MzScheme features substantially after the 52 release, it becomes
  clear that releases in fact enjoy different status.  As is common
  in commercial and other software, after the 52 release, we will
  make those distinctions apparent.  Specifically:

  <ul>
  <li>There will be major releases, sent out at intervals measured
      in years</li>
  <li>There will be minor releases of major release versions</li>
  <li>Version numbering may take the form of
      &LT;major&GT;.&LT;minor&GT;
      or similar notation</li>
  <li>Within major releases, versions should be backward compatible with
      minimal disruption to API's</li> 
</ul>
